# GTM-Scope

## Description
GTM-Scope is an interactive tool that allows users to upload .tm and .zip (with json) files to extract information about machine learning models trained with Google Teachable Machine. 
-The .tm file, accessible via 'Download project as a file' in Google Teachable Machine, provides basic model configurations like type, version, and training parameters. 
-The .zip file, available after training a model, selecting 'TensorFlow.js', and clicking 'Download my model', offers a comprehensive view including metadata, model summary, and weight information.

## How to Use
1. Upload a .tm file to get basic model information such as type, version, epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
2. Upload a corresponding .zip file to get detailed model information, including TensorFlow.js metadata, model summary, and weight sizes.
3. You can upload both files to get a complete set of information about your Google Teachable Machine model.

## Additional Information
This project was developed to facilitate the analysis and understanding of machine learning models. For suggestions or contributions, feel free to get in touch.
